Utility functions for simple Google Drive operations (count/delete).

These reuse the existing Drive client & helpers in your project:
- build_service(): initializes the Drive API client
- getIDFromURL(): extracts the file/folder ID from a Drive link
- get_Gfolder_size(): returns size in bytes for a file/folder (or -1 on error)
